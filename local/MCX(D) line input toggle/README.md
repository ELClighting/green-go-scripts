# MCX(D) line input toggle

Toggles the line input assignment on an MCX(D) allowing you to turn off and on the input for the whole system. 

Typically, we would implement program audio / show relay to a line input setting and forgetting the gain accordingly. There after adjustments to level/mute would be available to each user individually by assigning the associated group as a channel or using special channels.
